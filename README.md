# Project Intro: Food Delivery Time Prediction ðŸš€
==============================

Building FoodRush ETA, a ML-powered API that predicts food delivery times based on factors like restaurant preparation time, traffic conditions, and order details. 
The backend is a FastAPI service, deployed on Render, and integrated with MLflow & DVC for model tracking. The DVC-tracked data is stored in DagsHub, ensuring efficient 
version control and reproducibility

A CI/CD pipeline automates model training, testing, and deployment, ensuring continuous improvements. The entire setup runs in a Dockerized environment, making it 
production-ready and easily scalable. The API provides real-time delivery time estimates, helping food delivery platforms enhance customer experience.
